Such use is explicitly permitted under the Designer Platform terms above.

Your use of the Domain Services provided by Wuilt serves as your consent to these terms. Some of the service packages include Wuilt registering an Internet domain name or renewing your existing domain name (the “Domain Name”) on your behalf. For the purpose of procuring and/or maintaining domains, Wuilt will act only as the agent between you and the domain name service provider responsible for domain name allocation (the “Registrar”), which will be https://www.resellerclub.com/. All new registrations and subsequent renewals of those registrations will therefore also be subject to the https://www.resellerclub.com/ terms and conditions located at: https://www.resellerclub.com/legal-agreements. Wuilt reserves the right to utilize another domain name service provider at any time, in which case the terms and condition of such organization will apply complementarily to these Domain Terms and such other domain name service provider shall be deemed a “Registrar” for purposes of these Terms.<br/><br/>Wuilt may provide one (1) free domain name for up to one year, with a new purchase of an annual subscription plan. The domain will be included for the lifetime of your Wuilt account, and the domain will be registered in your name and is yours to keep, as long as you cover any applicable domain registration fees following the first year. The free domain name only applies to certain top-level domains (e.g. .com, .net, and .org) when signing up for a new plan.<br/><br/>You are responsible for providing correct and complete data regarding the domain name holder (“Registrant”) and the administrative contact when registering the domain name. The technical contact in all cases will be Wuilt LLC Before applying for a domain name, it is your responsibility to check that the domain name does not violate the rights of any third party or contravene any applicable law, rule or regulation. We may defer activation of a domain name until payment of the agreed fees for the registration services has been received.<br/><br/>Wuilt is in no position to influence the allocation of the domain name by the Registrar. We can neither guarantee that the requested domain names will be allocated to you and/or that allocated domain names are free of third-party rights nor guarantee their continued existence. Any information we provide regarding the availability of a domain name is based on the data provided by third parties and only refers to the time that information is requested. The domain will not be deemed as allocated before registration of the domain in the name of you, the Registrant, and its entry in the database of the Registrar.<br/><br/>The initial registration term for purchased domains may vary and such registration will auto-renew for successive 12-month periods. You will be charged for auto-renewal forty- five (45) calendar days before your domain expires (even if that date differs from your Wuilt website subscription renewal date). You can, of course, opt out of auto-renewal by turning off the auto-renew option in your settings at any time before the auto-renewal takes effect. Each purchased domain name is registered in your name and is yours to keep, as long as you pay the applicable fees. Your right and title to your domain name allows you to transfer a purchased domain to another domain provider; however, you will not be eligible for a refund of registration fees paid to Wuilt for transferred domains. Regardless of the identity of the Registrant or any other contact information in your domain name records, any domain name registered through Wuilt using your Wuilt account is covered by these Terms.<br/><br/>Maintaining accurate and current billing information is a mandatory condition of maintaining your Wuilt account. Such data must include the full and real name of the Registrant, a physical mailing address (PO boxes or anonymous addresses are not permissible), a valid email address and telephone number. If this information changes, you must immediately inform us of this change by updating it online. Please note that if your billing information, including your current credit card information, is not current, we will not renew your Domain Services and they may subsequently expire.<br/><br/>Subject to these Terms and those of the Registrar, you may transfer all domain names registered through us to another domain name service provider by following the online instructions provided by Wuilt. Should we, due to failure on the part of you, the account holder, or the new domain name service provider, be unable to make the domain transfer to your new domain name service provider, we are expressly entitled to have the cancelled domain name deleted by the relevant domain name service provider after the cancellation date has lapsed. We reserve the right to allow domain transfers only if you have settled all undisputed pending claims with us.<br/><br/>It may not always be possible to recover a domain name after it has expired, and Wuilt has sole discretion in determining when a domain name can be renewed post-expiry and what fees will be applicable. If you forfeit a domain name for non-payment, Wuilt will have the right, in its sole discretion, to: (a) register and use the domain name for its own purpose; (b) sell or transfer the domain name to a third party; or (c) delete the domain name and allow any new registrant anywhere in the world to register the domain name anew. Further, you agree that Wuilt may charge the credit card you have on file with Wuilt to recover any amounts outstanding on your account.<br/><br/>On certain occasions, domain name registrations may become the subject of a legal challenge. If Wuilt is made a party to any legal action by virtue of one of your domain name registrations, you agree to be responsible for all of Wuilt’s costs and legal fees and to indemnify and hold Wuilt harmless from any action. If Wuilt is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding your domain name, Wuilt may, at its sole discretion: (a) suspend your ability to use, make modifications to, or transfer your registration records; and/or (b) deposit control of your registration record with the appropriate judicial entity by supplying a registrar certificate from us.<br/><br/>You must notify us immediately if you lose the rights to a domain name registered by Wuilt on your behalf.</p><h5>19. Indemnity</h5><p class="paragraph-small">You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Wuilt, and its subsidiaries, licensors, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co- branders, partners, employees, successors, and assigns (collectively “Indemnified Parties”) from any and all liability, loss, claim, damages, expenses, costs or demands, (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees), incurred or made against the Indemnified Parties by any third party in connection with any claim arising from or related to: (a) your use (or anyone using your account/s) use of the Service, the Site or the Materials, (b) your Content, (c) any Commercial Products you offer on or through the Site or using our Services, or (d) your use of the Domain Services. This includes, but is not limited to, any breach or violation of these Terms by you or anyone utilizing your account. You must fully cooperate at your expense as required by an Indemnified Party. Each Indemnified Party may, at its election, assume the defense and control of any matter for which it is indemnified hereunder.
